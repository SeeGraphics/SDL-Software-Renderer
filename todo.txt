- add draw_triangle_filled, and circle 
- test it out on squares and other shapes

- try and make drawing shapes easier, propably in normalized space.
- refine structure, e.g seperation of code into files, file structure, 
small main loop, streamline shape creation, vertexes etc..., add more functions to simplify that
- keep dragging of vertexes independent of individual shapes, e.g not hardcoded.
for that maybe store all vertexes in a .txt, then if left mouse button is clicked
loop through that file to see if its a valid vertex, mutate it. or ask codex for a better solution.
- so engine.c propably?
