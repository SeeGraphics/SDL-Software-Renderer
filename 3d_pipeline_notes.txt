3D pipeline and camera overview
--------------------------------

- New math foundations (`src/math.h/.c`)
  - Added v3/v4 vector ops (dot, cross, normalize, add/sub/scale).
  - Added mat4 helpers: identity, multiply, translate, perspective(fov, aspect, near, far), and look-at view matrix.
  - Used everywhere to build the model-view-projection chain.

- Raster changes
  - `VertexPC` carries screen pos, UV, `inv_w`, and depth.
  - `draw_textured_triangle` now takes a depth buffer pointer and does perspective-correct UV (`u_over_w`/`v_over_w` divided by interpolated `inv_w`) plus depth test per pixel before sampling the texture.

- Main loop (`src/main.c`)
  - Keeps geometry in 3D (`Vertex3D tri[]`), converts to clip space via `MVP = projection * view * model`.
  - Maps NDC to screen with `norm_to_screen`, storing per-vertex `inv_w` and depth (NDC z remapped to 0–1) for the rasterizer.
  - Clears a float depth buffer each frame; color buffer stays ARGB8888.
  - Camera: position + yaw/pitch. Forward vector is built from yaw/pitch (Y-up, right-handed, -Z forward). Controls: WASD strafe/forward/back, SPACE up, Left Ctrl down, arrow keys to yaw/pitch (pitch clamped to avoid gimbal flip). ESC quits.
  - Projection: 60° fov, aspect = window size, near=0.1, far=100. Resize rebinds color/depth buffers and texture.
  - Texturing: loads `assets/texture.png` via SDL_image; adjust `texture_path` as needed.

- How the math maps to pixels
  - Model space -> (optional) model matrix -> view (camera) -> projection -> clip.
  - Perspective divide: NDC = clip / w. Skip tri if any z outside [0,1] (basic near/far reject).
  - Screen: NDC x/y in [-1,1] run through `norm_to_screen` (Y flipped for SDL’s top-left origin).
  - Depth: NDC z in [-1,1] remapped to [0,1] for depth buffer; lower is closer.

- How to tweak
  - Move the camera start: change `camera.pos` in `main`.
  - Faster/slower navigation: adjust `move_speed` and `look_speed`.
  - Different FOV/clip planes: change the args to `mat4_perspective`.
  - Different mesh: update `Vertex3D tri[]` or expand to an indexed mesh list; feed more triangles through the same MVP → raster path.
  - Turn off depth (for debugging): bypass the depth test in `draw_textured_triangle`.
  - Flip UV orientation: swap V (`uv.y -> 1.0f - uv.y`) or modify the interpolant before sampling.
